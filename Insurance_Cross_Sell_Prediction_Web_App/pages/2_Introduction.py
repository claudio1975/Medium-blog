The goal is to predict whether health insurance owners' from past year would also be interested in purchasing vehicle 
insurance coverage provided by the Company.

In the first step, the cross-selling prediction activity, have been used calibrated classifiers. Logistic Regression 
has been employed as a benchmark model and it has been compared with other machine learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes and Hist 
Gradient Boosting Machine. The ensemble model shows the best performance. 

In the second step, has been profiled customers interested in the purchasing coverage using K-means clustering method on numerical features 
and then applying the split to the all data set. In this way has been possible to understand relationships between 
numerical features as Annaul Premium and Age with categorical features.

# How to face a majority class greater than a minority class in a classification predictive modeling: from Caret to H2O

Read the [article](https://tinyurl.com/wzjmssr)

The goal followed is to have an overwiev about the classification task:

-What is a Classification Predictive Modeling

-Tipical issue with a classification task

-What are the strategies to face an unbalanced data set

-A practical application: a Loan Prediction model

There are pursued 4 approaches:

#### [Baseline models with Caret](https://rpubs.com/claudio75/570633)

#### [Sampling methods with Caret (over-sampling, down-sampling, SMOTE)](https://rpubs.com/claudio75/570653)

#### [Cost Sensitive models with Caret](https://rpubs.com/claudio75/570660)

#### [Sampling methods with H2O](https://rpubs.com/claudio75/570664)

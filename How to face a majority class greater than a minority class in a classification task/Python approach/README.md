### How to face a majority class greater than a minority class in a classification predictive modeling

Python approach:

-Baseline models (I've only encoded categorical variables and filled in missing values)

-Sampling Methods applied to the baseline models

-Stratified Cross-Validation applied to the baseline models

-Sampling Methods (OVER-SAMPLING, DOWN-SAMPLING) and Stratified Cross-Validation applied to the baseline models

-Sampling Methods (SMOTE, ADASYN) and Stratified Cross-Validation applied to the baseline models

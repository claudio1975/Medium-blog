# Zero-Shot Text Classification experience

Text classification is a task of natural language processing where the model needs to predict the classes of the text documents. The traditional approach requires a huge amount of labelled data to train the model and falls down when there is not enough labelled data in the training process. Solving text classification task with zero-shot learning we obtain the zero-shot text classification which is the task of classifying text documents without having seen any labelled text class before during the training process.

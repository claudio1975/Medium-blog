AI\\nis ﬁrst and foremost technology that can automatise (simple, lesse r) tasks and decision making\\nprocesses. At the present, AI systems are largely incapable of un derstanding meaning and the\\ncontext of their operation and results. At the same time, consider ing its societal impact and\\nneed for human contribution, AI is much more than an automation te chnique. When considering\\neﬀects and the governance thereof, the technology, or the art efact that embeds that technology,\\ncannot be separated from the ecosystem of which it is a component . In this sense, AI can best\\nbe understood as a socio-technical ecosystem, recognising the in teraction between people and\\ntechnology, and how complex infrastructures aﬀect and are aﬀec ted by society and by human\\nbehaviour [ Dignum,2019]. AI is not just about the automation of decisions and actions, the\\nadaptability to learn from the changes aﬀected in the environment, and the interactivity required\\nto be sensitive to the actions and aims of other agents in that enviro nment, and decide when to\\ncooperate or to compete. It is mostly about the structures of po wer, participation and access\\nto technology that determine who can inﬂuence which decisions or ac tions are being automated,\\nwhich data, knowledge and resources are used to learn from, and h ow interactions between those\\nthat decide and those that are impacted are deﬁned and maintained .\\nMuch has been said about the dangers of biased data, and discrimina ting applications. Min-\\nimising or eliminating discriminatory bias or unfair outcomes is more than excluding the use of\\nlow-quality data. The design of any artefact, such as an AI system , is in itself an accumulation of\\nchoices and choices are biased by nature as they involve selecting an option over another. Most\\nimportantly, it starts with the current reliance on data as a measur e of what can be done. In-\\ncreasingly, we are seeing that the availability of that (or the possibilit y to access data) is taken\\nas a guiding criteria to solving societal issues. If there is data, it is a p roblem we can address,\\nbut if there is no data, there is no problem. This is intrinsically related t o power and to power\\nstructures. Those that can decide on which problems are worth ad dress, are shaping not only how\\nAI is being developed and used, which technologies to use and what va lues to prioritise. Those in\\npower are shaping the way we live with AI and how our future societies will look like.\\nNevertheless, attention for the societal, environmental and clima te costs of AI systems is\\nincreasing. All these must be included in any eﬀort to ensure the res ponsible development and\\nuse of AI. A responsible, ethical, approach to AI will ensure transp arency about how adaptation\\nis done, responsibility for the level of automation on which the syste m is able to reason, and\\naccountability for the results and the principles that guide its intera ctions with others, most\\nimportantly with people. In addition, and above all, a responsible appr oach to AI makes clear\\nthat AI systems are artefacts manufactured by people for some purpose, and that those which\\nmake these have the power to decide on the use of AI. It is time to dis cuss how power structures\\ndetermine AIandhow AI establishes andmaintains power structure s, and onthebalance between,\\nthose who beneﬁt from, and those who are harmed by the use of AI [Crawford ,2021].\\nACM SIGIR Forum 3 Vol. 56 No. 1 June 2022', metadata={'source': './responsible_AI.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Understanding\\nthe capabilities and addressing the risks of AI, requires that all of u s, from developers to policy-\\nmakers, from provides to end-users and bystanders, have a clea r understanding of what AI is, how\\nit is applied and what are the opportunities and risks involved.\\n2 What AI is not: data, algorithms, magic\\nWithout a proper understanding of what AI is and what it can, and ca nnot, do, all the eﬀorts\\ntowards governance, regulation and the responsible development and use of AI have the risk to\\nbecome void. Current AI narratives bring forward beneﬁts and ris ks and describe AI in many\\ndiﬀerent ways, from the obvious next step in digitisation to some kind of magic. If the ‘business\\nas usual’ narrative is detrimental of innovation and contributes to the maintenance current power\\nstructures, the ‘magic’ narrative, well fed by science ﬁction and t he popular press, often supports\\na feeling that nothing can be done against such an all-knowing entity t hat rules over us in possibly\\nunexpected ways, either solving all our problems, or destroying th e world in the process. In both\\ncases, the danger is that the message is that little can be done again st the risks and challenges of\\nAI.\\nCurrently, AI is mostly associated with data-driven techniques tha t use statistical methods\\nto enable computers to perceive some characteristics of their env ironment. Such techniques are\\nparticularly eﬃcient in perceiving images, written or spoken text, as well as the many applications\\nof structured data. These techniques are extremely successfu l at pattern matching: By analysing\\nmany thousands of examples (typically a few million), the system is able to identify commonalities\\nin these examples, which then enable it to interpret data that it has n ever seen before, which is\\noften referred to as prediction. These results, however impress ive and useful, are still far from any\\nthing that we would consider as ‘intelligent’. Moreover, data-driven a pproaches to AI have been\\nproven to be problematic in terms of bias, explanation, inclusion and t ransparency. Algorithms\\nare too complex for human inspection, and a over-reliance on data, condemns the future to repeat\\nthe past. Indeed, data is always about the past, and decisions on w hich, how, when, why collect\\nand maintain data fundamentally inﬂuence the availability and quality of data. Those that have\\nthe power to decide on data, have the power to determine how AI sy stem will be design, deployed\\nand used.\\nAI is based on algorithms, but then so is any computer program and m ost of the technologies\\naround us. Nevertheless, the concept of ‘algorithm’ is achieving ma gical proportions, used right\\nand left to signify many things, de factoseen as a synonym to AI. The easiest way to understand\\nan algorithm is as a recipe, a set of precise rules to achieve a certain r esult. Every time you\\nmultiply two numbers, you are using an algorithm, as well as you are wh en you are baking an\\napple pie. However, by itself, the recipe has never turned into an ap ple pie; and, the end result\\nof your pie has as much to do with your baking skills and your choice of in gredients, as with the\\nchoice for a speciﬁc recipe. The same applies to AI algorithms: for a la rge part the behaviour and\\nresults of the system depends on its input data, and on the choices made by those that developed,\\ntrained and selected the algorithm.

On the contrary, r esponsible development and\\nuse of AI requires more responsibility and more accountability from t he people and organisations\\ninvolved: for the decisions and actions of the AI applications, and fo r their own decision of using\\nAI in a given application context [ Dignum,2022]. When considering eﬀects and the governance\\nthereof, the technology, or the artefact that embeds that tec hnology, cannot be separated from\\nthe socio-technical ecosystem of which it is a component. Guidelines , principles and strategies\\nto ensure trust and responsibility in AI, must be directed towards t he socio-technical ecosystem\\nin which AI is developed and used. It is not the AI artefact or applicat ion that needs to be\\nethical, trustworthy, or responsible. Rather, it is the social comp onent of this ecosystem that\\ncan and should take responsibility and act in consideration of an ethic al framework such that the\\noverall system can be trusted by the society. Having said this, gov ernance can be achieved by\\nseveral means, softer or harder. Currently several directions are being explored, the main ones are\\nhighlighted in the remainder of this section. Future research and ex perience will identify which\\napproaches are the most suitable, but given the complexity of the p roblem, it is very likely that\\na combination of approaches will be needed.\\nResponsible AI is more than the ticking of some ethical ‘boxes’ or the development of some\\nadd-on features in AI systems. Nevertheless, developers and us ers can beneﬁt from support and\\nconcrete steps to understand the relevant legal and ethical sta ndards and considerations when\\nmaking decisions on the use of AI applications. Impact assessment t ools provide a step-by-step\\nevaluation of the impact of systems, methods or tools on aspects s uch as privacy, transparency,\\nexplanation, bias, or liability [ Taddeo and Floridi ,2018].\\nInclusion and diversity are a broader societal challenge central to AI development. It is there-\\nfore important that as broad a group of people as possible have a ba sic knowledge of AI, what\\ncan (and can’t) be done with AI, and how AI impacts individual decision s and shapes society. In\\nparallel, research and development of AI systems must be informed by diversity, in all the mean-\\nings of diversity, and obviously including gender, cultural backgrou nd, and ethnicity. Moreover,\\nAI is not any longer an engineering discipline and at the same time there is growing evidence that\\ncognitive diversity contributes to better decision making. Therefo re, it is important to diversify\\nthe discipline background and expertise of those working on AI to inc lude AI professionals with\\nknowledge of, amongst others, philosophy, social science, law and economy.\\n4 Design for Responsibility\\nA multidisciplinary stance supporting understanding and critiquing th e intended and unforeseen,\\npositive and negative, and the socio-political consequences of AI f or society, is core to the re-\\nsponsible design of AI systems.

On the contrary, r esponsible development and\\nuse of AI requires more responsibility and more accountability from t he people and organisations\\ninvolved: for the decisions and actions of the AI applications, and fo r their own decision of using\\nAI in a given application context [ Dignum,2022]. When considering eﬀects and the governance\\nthereof, the technology, or the artefact that embeds that tec hnology, cannot be separated from\\nthe socio-technical ecosystem of which it is a component. Guidelines , principles and strategies\\nto ensure trust and responsibility in AI, must be directed towards t he socio-technical ecosystem\\nin which AI is developed and used. It is not the AI artefact or applicat ion that needs to be\\nethical, trustworthy, or responsible. Rather, it is the social comp onent of this ecosystem that\\ncan and should take responsibility and act in consideration of an ethic al framework such that the\\noverall system can be trusted by the society. Having said this, gov ernance can be achieved by\\nseveral means, softer or harder. Currently several directions are being explored, the main ones are\\nhighlighted in the remainder of this section. Future research and ex perience will identify which\\napproaches are the most suitable, but given the complexity of the p roblem, it is very likely that\\na combination of approaches will be needed.\\nResponsible AI is more than the ticking of some ethical ‘boxes’ or the development of some\\nadd-on features in AI systems. Nevertheless, developers and us ers can beneﬁt from support and\\nconcrete steps to understand the relevant legal and ethical sta ndards and considerations when\\nmaking decisions on the use of AI applications. Impact assessment t ools provide a step-by-step\\nevaluation of the impact of systems, methods or tools on aspects s uch as privacy, transparency,\\nexplanation, bias, or liability [ Taddeo and Floridi ,2018].\\nInclusion and diversity are a broader societal challenge central to AI development. It is there-\\nfore important that as broad a group of people as possible have a ba sic knowledge of AI, what\\ncan (and can’t) be done with AI, and how AI impacts individual decision s and shapes society. In\\nparallel, research and development of AI systems must be informed by diversity, in all the mean-\\nings of diversity, and obviously including gender, cultural backgrou nd, and ethnicity. Moreover,\\nAI is not any longer an engineering discipline and at the same time there is growing evidence that\\ncognitive diversity contributes to better decision making. Therefo re, it is important to diversify\\nthe discipline background and expertise of those working on AI to inc lude AI professionals with\\nknowledge of, amongst others, philosophy, social science, law and economy.\\n4 Design for Responsibility\\nA multidisciplinary stance supporting understanding and critiquing th e intended and unforeseen,\\npositive and negative, and the socio-political consequences of AI f or society, is core to the re-\\nsponsible design of AI systems. This multidisciplinary approach is fund amental to understand\\ngovernance, not only in terms of competences and responsibilities, but also in terms of power,\\ntrust and accountability; to analyse the societal, legal and econom ic functioning of socio-technical\\nsystems, providing value-based design approaches and ethical fr ameworks for inclusion and diver-\\nsity in design, and how such strategies may inform processes and re sults.\\nACM SIGIR Forum 4 Vol. 56 No. 1 June 2022', metadata={'source': './responsible_AI.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n",

Core values, as well as the processes used for value elicitation, must be\\nmade explicit and that all stakeholders are involved in this process. F urthermore, the methods\\nused for the elicitation processes and the decisions of who is involved in the value identiﬁcation\\nprocess must be clearly identiﬁed and documented.\\nWhere it concerns the design process itself, responsibility includes t he need to elicit and rep-\\nresent stakeholders, their values and expectations, as well as en suring transparency about how\\nsuch values are interpreted and prioritised in the concrete functio nalities of the AI system. Design\\nfor Values methodologies [ van den Hoven ,2005;Friedman et al. ,2006] are often used for this end,\\nproviding a structured way for translationfromabstract values in to concrete norms comprehensive\\nenough so that fulﬁlling the norm will be considered as adhering to the value. Following a Design\\nfor Values approach, the shift from abstract to concrete neces sarily involves careful consideration\\nof the context. Design for Values approach means that the proce ss needs to include activities for\\n(i) theidentiﬁcation of societal values, (ii) deciding ona moraldeliber ation approach(e.g. through\\nalgorithms, user control or regulation), and (3) linking values to fo rmal system requirements and\\nconcrete functionalities.\\nMy research group is developing the Glass Box framework [ Aler Tubella and Dignum ,2019]\\nthat is both an approach to software development, a veriﬁcation m ethod and a source of high-level\\ntransparency for intelligent systems. It provides a modular appro ach integrating veriﬁcation with\\nvalue-based design.\\n5 Conclusions\\nIncreasingly, AI systems will be taking decisions that aﬀect our lives , in smaller or larger ways.\\nIn all areas of application, AI must be able to take into account socie tal values, moral and eth-\\nical considerations, weigh the respective priorities of values held by diﬀerent stakeholders and\\nin multicultural contexts, explain its reasoning, and guarantee tra nsparency. As the capabili-\\nties for autonomous decision-making grow, perhaps the most impor tant issue to consider is the\\nneed to rethink responsibility. Being fundamentally tools, AI system s are fully under the control\\nand responsibility of their owners or users. However, their potent ial autonomy and capability\\nto learn, require that design considers accountability, responsibilit y and transparency principles\\nin an explicit and systematic manner. The development of AI algorithm s has so far been led\\nby the goal of improving performance, leading to opaque black boxe s. Putting human values at\\nthe core of AI systems calls for a mind-shift of researchers and de velopers towards the goal of\\nimproving transparency rather than performance, which will lead t o novel and exciting techniques\\nand applications.\\nFinally, it is crucial to understand responsibility, regulation and ethic s as stepping-stone for\\ninnovation, rather than theoften referred hinder to innovation. True innovation is moving technol-\\nogy forward, not use existing technology ‘as is’. Taking responsibility and regulation as beacons\\npointing the direction to move, will not only lead to better technology but also ensure trust and\\npublic acceptance, serve as a drive for transformation and for bu siness diﬀerentiation. Eﬀorts in\\nfundamental research are part of this. Currently, much AI ‘innov ation’ is based on brute force:\\nwhen the main data analytics paradigm is correlation, better accura cy is achieved by increased\\nACM SIGIR Forum 5 Vol. 56 No. 1 June 2022', metadata={'source': './responsible_AI.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

AI\\nis ﬁrst and foremost technology that can automatise (simple, lesse r) tasks and decision making\\nprocesses. At the present, AI systems are largely incapable of un derstanding meaning and the\\ncontext of their operation and results. At the same time, consider ing its societal impact and\\nneed for human contribution, AI is much more than an automation te chnique. When considering\\neﬀects and the governance thereof, the technology, or the art efact that embeds that technology,\\ncannot be separated from the ecosystem of which it is a component . In this sense, AI can best\\nbe understood as a socio-technical ecosystem, recognising the in teraction between people and\\ntechnology, and how complex infrastructures aﬀect and are aﬀec ted by society and by human\\nbehaviour [ Dignum,2019]. AI is not just about the automation of decisions and actions, the\\nadaptability to learn from the changes aﬀected in the environment, and the interactivity required\\nto be sensitive to the actions and aims of other agents in that enviro nment, and decide when to\\ncooperate or to compete. It is mostly about the structures of po wer, participation and access\\nto technology that determine who can inﬂuence which decisions or ac tions are being automated,\\nwhich data, knowledge and resources are used to learn from, and h ow interactions between those\\nthat decide and those that are impacted are deﬁned and maintained .\\nMuch has been said about the dangers of biased data, and discrimina ting applications. Min-\\nimising or eliminating discriminatory bias or unfair outcomes is more than excluding the use of\\nlow-quality data. The design of any artefact, such as an AI system , is in itself an accumulation of\\nchoices and choices are biased by nature as they involve selecting an option over another. Most\\nimportantly, it starts with the current reliance on data as a measur e of what can be done. In-\\ncreasingly, we are seeing that the availability of that (or the possibilit y to access data) is taken\\nas a guiding criteria to solving societal issues. If there is data, it is a p roblem we can address,\\nbut if there is no data, there is no problem. This is intrinsically related t o power and to power\\nstructures. Those that can decide on which problems are worth ad dress, are shaping not only how\\nAI is being developed and used, which technologies to use and what va lues to prioritise. Those in\\npower are shaping the way we live with AI and how our future societies will look like.\\nNevertheless, attention for the societal, environmental and clima te costs of AI systems is\\nincreasing. All these must be included in any eﬀort to ensure the res ponsible development and\\nuse of AI. A responsible, ethical, approach to AI will ensure transp arency about how adaptation\\nis done, responsibility for the level of automation on which the syste m is able to reason, and\\naccountability for the results and the principles that guide its intera ctions with others, most\\nimportantly with people. In addition, and above all, a responsible appr oach to AI makes clear\\nthat AI systems are artefacts manufactured by people for some purpose, and that those which\\nmake these have the power to decide on the use of AI.

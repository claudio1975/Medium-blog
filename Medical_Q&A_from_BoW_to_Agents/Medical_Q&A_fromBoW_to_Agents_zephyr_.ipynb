These symptoms usually appear suddenly and can last several days to two weeks. If you suspect having the flu, it's best to stay home, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid contact with others to prevent spreading the virus. Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve fever and body aches, and antiviral medication may be prescribed by a healthcare provider if diagnosed early.\n"
